VVSceneLinearImageRep is a subclass of NSBitmapImageRep that specifically deals with floating-point scene linear images. There is also a class extension (NSImage+SceneLinear) that helps manage loading, saving, converting, and querying images with scene linear data.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

VVSceneLinearImageRep is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "VVSceneLinearImageRep"
    
## Requirements

At the moment this is Mac only - this will not work with UIImage as far as I know.
